# A-Jurassic-Adventure
This is an Alura's Project, I created a little game on a website using VSCode and some code I learned in the course Algorithms: creating an adventure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I hope it's good, because it's my second time using VSCode and this specific project took a lot of my time and effort! I hope you all like it as much as I do! Kisses&lt;3.
